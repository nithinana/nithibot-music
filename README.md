# nithibot-music
A node.js music bot for Discord that uses Youtube's API to stream music directly to a voice channel.

Create a file called .env and type your Bot Token which can be found in the Discord Developer Portal and run the files in node.js for the bot to work.
If you succeeded a website will be hosted on your local/virtual machine saying the bot is up.
